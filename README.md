# Breast-Cancer-Analysis
Breast Cancer Analysis using Logistic Regression
# Overview
Breast cancer is a disease in which the healthy cells of the tissue in the breast are invaded and mutated, which further grow in large numbers to form a malignant tumor.  It can most likely occur at any age.
## Objective
The aim of this study to bring across is optimizing a classification algorithm to give most accurate results.  The machine learning algorithm used in this context is Logistic Regression (LR).  The evaluation metrics used are accuracy, ROC, confusion matrix, precision-recall.
## Dataset
The Wisconsin Breast Cancer (Diagnostic) dataset has been extracted from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. 
Class distribution: 357 benign, 212 malignant
Number of instances: 569;   Number of attributes: 32
## Preprocessing
The aim of the work is to improve machine learning algorithms to achieve the classification transformation.
## Model
Classification using Logistic Regression + RFE with hyper parameter as "accuracy" and "recall"
Ensembling using VotingClassifier 
## Evaluation metrics for classification
Confusion Matrix, Accuracy, Precision, Recall & ROC
